    "### 🧹 Data Preparation and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "During this stage, the dataset was prepared and standardized to ensure that all columns had the correct format for analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, all column names were cleaned by removing extra spaces and converting them to lowercase. This provided a consistent naming style, making it easier to reference and manipulate columns throughout the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the **year_of_release** column was converted from *float* to *integer* (`Int64`). Since years should not appear as decimal numbers, this change ensured a proper numeric format while allowing missing values to remain without causing errors during analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the **user_score** column, some records contained the abbreviation “TBD” (To Be Determined), meaning that a score had not yet been assigned. These entries were replaced with missing values (`NaN`) and the column was converted to a *float* type. This transformation allows mathematical operations and statistical analyses to be performed safely on user ratings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the **critic_score** column was converted to a numeric format to keep consistency between user and critic evaluations, enabling direct comparison and correlation in later stages of the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **rating** column, which represents the ESRB classification of each game, contained some missing values. These were replaced with the word **“Unknown”** to prevent issues when grouping or visualizing data, while still keeping those records in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these transformations ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and fully ready for the exploratory data analysis phase."

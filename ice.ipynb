    "### 🧹 Data Preparation and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "During this stage, the dataset was cleaned and standardized to ensure that all columns had the proper format for analysis and that only relevant records remained.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, all column names were cleaned by removing extra spaces and converting them to lowercase. This provided a consistent and easy-to-use naming convention throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the **year_of_release** column was converted from *float* to *integer* (`Int64`). Since years should not appear with decimal values, this step ensured that each year was represented correctly while still allowing missing entries to remain as null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **user_score** column contained some non-numeric entries such as “TBD” (To Be Determined), which indicate that a user score had not yet been assigned. These values were replaced with missing values (`NaN`), and the column was then converted to a numeric format. This allows mathematical and statistical operations to be performed safely on user scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the **rating** column, which represents the ESRB classification of each game, had missing values that were replaced with the word **“Unknown.”** This ensures that games without an official rating can still be included in summaries and visualizations without producing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "After standardizing column formats, rows missing critical information such as the **game name** or **genre** were removed. Records without these attributes cannot contribute meaningful insights to the analysis, as they cannot be identified or categorized by type.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain data integrity, duplicate entries were also removed based on the combination of **name** and **platform**, keeping only the first occurrence of each unique pair. Additionally, games missing the **year_of_release** were dropped since the release year is essential for studying temporal trends and forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a new column called **total_sales** was created by summing the regional sales across **North America, Europe, Japan, and Other regions.** This provides a unified measure of each game’s overall commercial performance and will be used extensively in the exploratory and comparative analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these transformations, the dataset is now clean, consistent, and fully ready for exploratory data analysis, ensuring that all future findings are based on reliable and well-structured information.\n"
